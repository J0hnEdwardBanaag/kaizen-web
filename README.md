# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Error in vercel deployment
The error indicates that your PowerShell execution policy restricts running scripts. To resolve this, you can change the execution policy temporarily to allow script execution. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

After running the above command, try running the `vercel login` command again. Once you're done, you can set the execution policy back to its original state:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Default
```

Keep in mind that changing the execution policy comes with security implications, so be cautious and understand the risks involved.
